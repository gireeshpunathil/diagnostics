## Agenda

## Announcements
 
*Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.
  * Qard: currently working on JSFunction version of PromiseHook API, aiming to improve performance
  * ref: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/2466783

### nodejs/node

* lib: add span API to diagnostics_channel [#35534](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/35534)
  * separated out from the channel to iterate and converge. Needs more reviews, feedback
    and iterations.
  * Do we need a separate API for span, as opposed to a field in the (diagnostic) channel?

* lib: make diagnostics_channel async iterable  [#35532](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/35532)
  * Comment if you believe this is needed, otherwise may be dropped for now.

* Proposal: mark AsyncResource and AsyncLocalStorage as stable [#35286](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/35286)
  * AsyncResource seems like consensus that it can go stable
  * AsyncLocalStorage needs more time to bake, in particular discussion around
    The enterWith. 
  * Need to define experimental ‘exit’ criteria AsyncLocalStorage.

* lib: create diagnostics_channel module [#34895](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/34895)
  * 

* Node.js' internal scripts should be hidden in the inspector. [#11893](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/11893)
  * delay for the next instance

### nodejs/diagnostics

* Add ioredis to problematic-modules.md [#430](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/pull/430)
  * Team review in a deep dive session
* Node CPU Profiling Roadmap [#148](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/148)
  * rafaelgss will review output from the deep dive, and the original profiling roadmap and then
    open new issue to capture next steps.

* \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
  * Quard has been open for a long time, not sure if we need on the agenda.
  * Would be better to have issue that better reflects the current thinking
